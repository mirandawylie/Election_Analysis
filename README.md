The election analysis script can be used for any election by importing a different .csv file. Instead of the winner, the top three candidates could be identified noting the percentage differences between each candidate. The age and gender identity of each candidate could be inputted in the data to better understand the similarities and difference with each candidate. And lastly, with additional data on registered voters we could compare voter turnout and registered voters.
